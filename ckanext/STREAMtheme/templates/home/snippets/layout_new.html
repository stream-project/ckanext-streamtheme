    <p>
    The STREAM Data Manager prototype was developed to support the aspect of better re-usability of research data. The prototype supports the management and access to heterogeneous research data publications and assists researchers in the selection of relevant data sets for their respective disciplines.

      The prototype currently offers the following functions for the visualization of research data:

      ·         Different views on the same data set (2D and 3D support).
      <br>
      ·         Visualization of Auto CAD files.
      <br>
      ·         Jupyter Notes for demonstrating live code.
